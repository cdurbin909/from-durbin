# Chase Durbin & Jacob Layman

### Freddy's

Chase - I like freddy's because they have **really good** cheese curds, and their ice cream is also **delicious**. I also really like the burgers, but I have to get a double cheeseburger because they're very thin bugers.

Jake - I like freddy's because they're fries are the **best**.
